# Toad Mod General Character Changes (as of version 0.17.0)
*note, this will not be an exhaustive list of changes, I will miss some, but I am mainly looking to note the general changes to a character as someone who did not write any code for the mod*

Things to expect in general:
- Better movement (fall speed, air speed, ground speed, traction changes)
- Large women (Don't ask me)

## Dr Mario
Generally feels the same as vanilla Dr Mario, though with some funky moves and stronger movement
- Up tilt and Up smash send more horizontally
- Dtilt sends backwards
- Bair sends up
- Dthrow, Up air and Down air are electric
- Down B makes you flat
- Dash attack slides back near the end of  the animation
- Forward throw sends up

## Mario
Has been hitting the gym. His arms are longer (this changes hitboxes)
- Down-Angle forward tilt sends downwards
- Dash attack is more zippy
- Fthrow reduced knockback and sends up
- Upthrow reduced knockback and sends forward

## Luigi
Run speed, fall speed, and traction are greatly increased
- Dtilt does more damage
- Fthrow reduced knockback and sends up
- Upthrow reduced knockback and sends forward
- Dash attack can be cancelled after some frames
- Aerial up b goes much higher
- Side B odds changed, cancels lag on landing, can cancel with ledge grab after firing
- Fair is now Dair
- Dair just doesnt work at all and its also sideways
- Upair is now electric
- Nair sends out

## Bowser
Rather than list move changes, he now has:
- a much better dash dance
- a 3f jumpsquat & higher jumps
- reduced landing lag on aerials
- Armour on smash attacks

## Peach
Peach is now larger.
- 3f jumpsquat
- electric turnips
- faster weaker fair
- reduced traction for better WDs

## Toad
Brand new character
- press down b on ground to charge toad meter (up to 3 times). This changes movement and jumping.
- Side b is broken

## Yoshi
Better dashdance
- ftilt, Fair & upsmash send out
- Dtilt sends up more
- Dair meteors on each hit
- DJC works more like ness?
- As of v0.20.0, Yoshi now can jump out of shield and no longer has DJC
- Up tilt has high base knockback
- Grabs are faster & more reliable
- Up air sends slightly more out
- Side B is now a recovery move, with a high jump at the start
- Fair is much faster

## DK
Better dashdance and higher jumps, better ff
- Dtilt hits much harder
- Dash attack movement changed slightly
- Upair sends a bit more outwards
- Bair sends down
- Dair is insane.

## Captain Falcon
Made of ooblek
- Jab 3 is electric
- Knee sends more upwards
- Dair sends more outwards
- (grounded) Down B can be  jump-cancelled (at any point other than hitlag)
- Falcon punch now scales with falcons momentum (in any direction) at the point of input
- Faclon can grab ledge after side B, side B from stage to offstage does not go into freefall

## Falco
is very fun
- Has a new fair - it's a sideways dair
- Dair lasts a few frames longer
- Laser
  - Does not have knockback at close range
  - Gets stronger the longer it has been out (regardless of ownership)
  - Sends opponent in the direction the laser came from (sends inwards)
- Shine sends behind falco
- Nair sends more upwards
- Upair does more damage?
- Uptilt sends out
- Dsmash sends upwards? Need to check

## Fox
We getting weird 
- Upsmash, Upair, Uptilt, Dtilt send more outwards
- Nair sends more upwards
- Backair sends backwards (hard to explain)
- Shine pops opponents more upwards
- Dsmash sends upwards
- Laser
  - Laser meter builds throughout a stock
  - Using neutral B will drain some of the meter
  - Using neutral B without any meter puts a grounded fox into (untechable) knockdown and an aerial fox into freefall
  - Laser now fires a shine which sends upwards
  - A fox firing lasers while grounded can continue to fire lasers once the meter drains as long as it is non-stop from when he had meter
- New dthrow
- Throws are not effected by the laser change - the shines in throws are only graphical changes

## Ness
Much better movement, especially jumps
- Ftilt has extra (electric) hitbox, can multihit
- Uptilt has extra (electric) hitboxes, final hits send out and down
- Up b projectile has much better mobility
- Nair and fair have extra (electric) hitboxes. Nair is bigger because of this
- Down B is now a shine, similar to Fox's

## Ice climbers
don't
- nana is larger

## Ganondorf
- Uptilt has multihit on startup
- Downtilt sends up and behind
- Second hit of nair sends down
- Dair sends more outwards
- Up-b on hit sends ganon zooming upwards
- A neutral B completed in the air kills Ganondorf
- Down b
  - Grounded down b launches ganon into the air
  - Aerial down b, upon landing, slides along the ground with a hitbbox for a part of the slide
  - Fthrow sends more downwards
  - Aerial neutral B kills ganon

## Young link
- All of his tilts are much faster in terms of endlag
- His slow turnaround sends him flying across the stage
- Movement such as moonwalk is improved
- Bomb has multiple more hits

## Mewtwo
I like this mewtwo

  - The hitbox only happens if the shield release animation occurs
